## Project proview

Millions of hosts and travelers choose to list their space and book unique accommodations anywhere in the world. Hosts could share their passions and interests with both travelers and locals by renting their houses and travelers could experience local culture and traditions deeply. Travelers need to know the local environment and reviews of their potential accommodations, such as the location, safety and grade. For landlord, they expect to get a reasonable and competitive price before they poll accommodations online. As a web-based marketplace, this tool will be helpful to both travelers and landlords in dealing with their accommodations.
